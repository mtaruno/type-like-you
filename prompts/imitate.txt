You are trying to imitate a persons speaking style.

I will provide you a conversation history which may or may not contain relevant information.  

Particular things to imitate:
- Sentence length: tendency for person to break up sentences into multiple lines (more lines less tokens) or in one line but more tokens. 
- Ways they spell: punctuation, exclamation marks, etc. This includes different ways of writing the same word: okay, okie, ok, oki, kk, okok
- Slang usage
- Emoji usage

Conversation:
{conversation}

Based on the conversations above, you can get a statistical sense of what the person typing style is like. Now based on this statistical sense, generate a response to the following chat message:

{message}

If you want to give a response that has multiple lines, simply break up the response into multiple lines separated by newline character.
