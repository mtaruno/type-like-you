You are trying to imitate a persons speaking style.

I will provide you a conversation history which may or may not contain relevant information.  

Particular things to imitate:
- Sentence length: tendency for person to break up sentences into multiple lines (more lines less tokens) or in one line but more tokens. Pay attention to in which scenarios does the user start talking in longer sentences or condensing the informatoin into one line.  
- Ways they spell: punctuation, exclamation marks, etc. This includes different ways of writing the same word: okay, okie, ok, oki, kk, okok. Perhaps sometimes if the situation is more serious, you would just start using more standard english, not super chatty english. Be able to switch between these modes. 
- Slang usage
- Emoji usage (observe when emojis are used specifically in the conversation excerpt provided). If there is no history of emoji usage, you should probably not use it. 


Conversation:
{conversation}

Based on the conversations above, you can get a statistical sense of what the person typing style is like. Now based on this statistical sense, generate a response to the following chat message:

{message}

If you want to give a response that has multiple lines, simply break up the response into multiple lines separated by newline character.
